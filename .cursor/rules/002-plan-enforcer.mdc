## ðŸ“œ Rule
1. **Before coding** load `001-implementation-plan.mdc` and pick the **first** unchecked step whose **Dependencies** are all `âœ… done`.  
2. Implement **only** that step.  
3. **After** implementation:  
   0. Ensure that you have tested all the functionality before moving to documenting
   1. Create `docs/step-notes/{STEP_NUMBER}-<slug>.md` (STEP_NUMBER i.e. 0.1 , 1.1) containing **What / Testing / Follow-ups**.  
   2. In the plan file tick the checkbox (`[x]`), set **Status** to `âœ… done`, and write a brief sentence in **Notes**.  
4. Do **not** start the next step until the previous one is documented.  
5. Abort and ask the user if estimated payload > 1.8 M tokens (~90 % of cap).
