### Project
“Repo Prompt-lite” — an Electron 30 + React 18 desktop utility  
* Dark theme only  
* Target **macOS** (`arm64`, `x64`) — **no Windows builds**  
* Skip any binary file or any file ≥ 1 MB during copy

### Coding Guidelines
* Use Tailwind classes (`dark:` prefix already applied)  
* Prefer React function components with hooks  
* Unit tests: Vitest + RTL • E2E: Playwright

### Token Budget
Total `<file_contents>` must stay **≤ 2 M tokens** (≈ 8 MB plain text).  
Warn and abort copy if the estimate exceeds 90 % of that.
