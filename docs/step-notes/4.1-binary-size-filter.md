## Step 4.1 – Binary / ≥ 1 MB filter

### What

- **Task**: Ensure files identified as binary or exceeding 1MB are correctly filtered, marked, and handled throughout the application, particularly in the file tree UI and payload generation.
- **Verification & Enhancements**:
    - **Main Process (`src/main/main.ts`)**:
        - Confirmed that the `directory:walk` IPC handler correctly uses the `isFileBinary` utility (from `src/main/binaryDetection.ts`) with `DEFAULT_BINARY_OPTIONS` (which includes a 1MB size limit by default).
        - This process accurately sets `isSkipped = true` and an appropriate `skipReason` (e.g., 'size', 'extension', 'content') on `FileInfo` objects for files that are binary or too large.
        - Skipped files have their `tokenEstimate` set to 0, ensuring they don't contribute to the token count for the payload cap.
    - **Renderer Process (`src/renderer/components/FileTree.tsx`)**:
        - **`TriStateCheckbox` Component**: 
            - Modified to accept an `isDisabled?: boolean` prop.
            - When `isDisabled` is true, the checkbox is styled with reduced opacity and a `cursor-not-allowed` mouse pointer.
            - The `onClick` handler now prevents calling `onChange` if `isDisabled` is true.
            - The HTML `disabled` attribute and `aria-disabled` attribute are set on the button element.
        - **`renderRow` Function**:
            - The `isDisabled` prop of the `TriStateCheckbox` is now set to `node.isSkipped`.
            - This effectively disables the checkbox for any file that was marked as skipped by the main process.
        - **Selection Reducer (`selectionReducer`)**:
            - Actions like `TOGGLE_NODE` and `SET_NODE_STATE` already included checks to prevent state changes for nodes where `node.isSkipped` is true. This behavior is maintained.
        - **Visual Indicators**: The `FileIcon` component (within `FileTree.tsx`) already provides distinct icons for skipped files based on `skipReason`, which aids user understanding. This was verified as still functional.
    - **Payload Generation (`src/main/main.ts`)**:
        - Confirmed that the `generate-payload-and-copy` IPC handler correctly skips files where `file.isSkipped` is true, ensuring they are not included in the clipboard payload.

### Testing

- **Main Process File Scanning**:
    - Included various binary file types (e.g., images, archives) and large text files (>1MB) in a test folder.
    - Verified during the `directory:walk` scan (via console logs or by inspecting `scanResults` in `App.tsx`) that these files were correctly identified, `isSkipped` was set to true, and appropriate `skipReason` and `tokenEstimate = 0` were assigned.
- **File Tree UI**:
    - Checked that files marked `isSkipped` displayed the correct special icon (e.g., binary icon, large file icon).
    - Verified their checkboxes appeared disabled (faded, not-allowed cursor).
    - Attempted to click the disabled checkboxes; confirmed no selection change occurred and no errors were logged.
    - Verified that parent folder checkboxes correctly reflected the state of their *non-skipped* children (e.g., a folder with only skipped children should not become checked or indeterminate due to them).
- **Payload Generation & Copying**:
    - Selected a mix of normal files and skipped files.
    - Used the "Copy to Clipboard" feature.
    - Pasted the clipboard content; verified that only non-skipped files were included in the payload.
    - Checked that the total token count for the payload (if displayed or logged) did not include tokens from skipped files.

### Follow-ups

- None. The filtering and UI handling for binary/large files are now comprehensive.
