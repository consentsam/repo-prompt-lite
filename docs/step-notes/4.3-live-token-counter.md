# Live Token Counter in UI Implementation

## What
Added a live token counter component to the UI that provides real-time feedback on token usage. This feature helps users monitor their token consumption as they select files, with visual cues to indicate when they're approaching or exceeding token limits.

### Key features:
1. Created a dedicated TokenCounter component with token count and percentage visualization
2. Integrated the counter in multiple strategic locations in the UI for visibility
3. Added visual states to indicate normal, warning, and exceeding token usage
4. Implemented animations to provide feedback when token counts change

## Technical Details

### TokenCounter Component
- Designed a reusable component that accepts selected files, token limit, and warning threshold
- Implemented a progress bar to visualize the percentage of tokens used
- Added color-coding: blue for normal usage, yellow for warning threshold, red for exceeding limits
- Used subtle animations to draw attention to token count changes

### UI Integration
- Added a primary token counter at the top of the file tree for high visibility
- Implemented a secondary counter next to the copy button to make it visible during scrolling
- Made the component responsive with appropriate sizing for different screen sizes
- Used Tailwind CSS for consistent styling with the rest of the application

## Testing

### Test Cases
1. **Empty selection**: Verified the counter shows 0 tokens when no files are selected
2. **Normal usage**: Checked correct counting and blue styling for normal token usage
3. **Warning threshold**: Confirmed the counter changes to yellow styling when approaching the limit
4. **Exceeding limit**: Verified the counter turns red and the copy button is disabled when exceeding the limit
5. **Dynamic updates**: Tested that the counter updates in real-time when files are selected or deselected

### Results
- Successfully implemented real-time token counting with appropriate visual feedback
- Users now have immediate feedback on token usage without needing to check the statistics panel
- The color-coding provides intuitive understanding of token usage status
- Animation draws attention to changes in token count when making selections

## Follow-ups
1. Consider adding a tooltip with more detailed token usage information
2. Explore optimizations for very large repositories to reduce calculation time
3. Add the ability to customize token limits and warning thresholds
4. Consider implementing token allocation visualization by file type
