# Step 3.1 - Flatten Selection

## What Was Done
- Created a new `selectionUtils.ts` utility file with functions for handling selected files
- Implemented `getSelectedFiles()` to extract files from user selection (excluding directories and binaries)
- Added token count calculation and limit checking functions
- Integrated the utilities into the App component
- Added a selection summary UI with token count and percentage indicators
- Created warning and error states when approaching or exceeding token limits
- Created shared type definitions in a common types file

## Implementation Details
- Centralized types in a `common.ts` file to ensure type consistency across components
- Added helper functions to calculate token usage and format numbers
- Implemented visual progress bar for token limit usage 
- Created warning states at 90% of token limit and error state when exceeding the limit
- Used color coding (blue → yellow → red) to indicate token usage levels
- Added proper error handling to prevent copying when token limit is exceeded
- Sorted selected files by relativePath for consistent ordering

## Testing
- Verified that file selection works properly
- Confirmed token count calculations are accurate
- Tested token limit warnings and errors display correctly
- Ensured that UI updates properly when selection changes
- Checked that the progress bar reflects token usage percentage accurately

## Follow-ups
- Implement ASCII tree formatter in the next step (3.2)
- Add the ability to clipboard copy the selected files (3.3)
- Consider adding sorting options for the file selection
