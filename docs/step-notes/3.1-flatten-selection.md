# Step 3.1 - Flatten Selection

## What Was Implemented

1. **Enhanced Selection Utilities**:
   - Improved the `selectionUtils.ts` with more comprehensive functions
   - Implemented `flattenSelection()` to recursively traverse the file tree
   - Added functions for filtering, grouping, and analyzing selected files
   - Created utilities for file extension analysis and statistics

2. **Advanced Selection Statistics**:
   - Created a new `SelectionStats` component for detailed selection analysis
   - Added file type breakdown with size and token distribution
   - Implemented a responsive UI with proper error states and warnings
   - Visualized statistics with progress bars and color-coded indicators

3. **Improved App UI Flow**:
   - Updated the main App component to use the new selection utilities
   - Added toggle controls to switch between statistics and file map preview
   - Enhanced the user experience with clearer UI organization
   - Improved the token limit warnings and feedback

4. **FileTree Integration**:
   - Updated the FileTree component to use the new flattening utilities
   - Simplified the file selection logic with centralized utilities
   - Ensured consistent file ordering in all selection operations
   - Maintained proper selection state propagation to parent components

## Testing

- Verified that the selection flattening correctly extracts all selected files
- Confirmed that the statistics component accurately displays file counts, sizes, and tokens
- Tested file extension grouping and filtering
- Ensured that token limit warnings appear at appropriate thresholds
- Verified that the selection state is maintained when toggling between views
- Confirmed that the file tree selection updates are properly propagated

## Follow-ups

- Consider adding search and filter capabilities in the statistics view
- Add sorting options for the file type breakdown (by size, count, or extension)
- Improve performance for very large repositories with lazy loading
- Consider adding file selection history or the ability to save selections
