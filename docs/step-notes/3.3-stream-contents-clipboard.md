# Step 3.3 - Stream contents & clipboard write

## What was implemented
- Implemented file content streaming with real-time progress tracking
- Added clipboard writing functionality with proper error handling
- Enforced a 2 million token cap with graceful handling of limit exceeding
- Added comprehensive progress UI for file processing operations

## Technical details
- Created efficient content streaming pipeline for selected files
- Added a new `file:readContent` IPC handler in the main process
- Implemented `clipboard:writePrompt` IPC handler for secure clipboard access
- Built token counting system with cap enforcement
- Added progress reporting through callbacks to update UI in real-time
- Implemented error handling for binary files, oversized files, and read errors
- Added visual indicators for copy operation progress and result

## Testing
1. Verified token limit enforcement by selecting files exceeding 2M tokens
2. Tested clipboard write operation with files of various sizes and types
3. Confirmed progress UI updates correctly during copying process
4. Verified error handling for invalid files and oversized content
5. Confirmed successful feedback after clipboard operations
6. Tested partial copying when token limit is reached

## Follow-ups
- Consider adding a "Partial Copy" option to allow exceeding token limit with truncation
- Add option to save prompt to file in addition to clipboard
- Consider compression or optimization for very large files
