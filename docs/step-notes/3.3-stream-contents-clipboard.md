# Step 3.3 - Stream Contents & Clipboard Write

## What Was Done
- Added IPC handlers for reading file contents and writing to clipboard
- Created `promptUtils.ts` with functions to build the complete prompt with file contents
- Implemented API types for the new functionality
- Added clipboard writing functionality to the App component with success/error feedback
- Added loading state to show when files are being processed
- Added error handling for binary files and files too large to include

## Implementation Details
- Added a new `file:readContent` IPC handler in the main process
- Skipped binary files and files â‰¥ 1MB during the content reading
- Implemented asynchronous file reading to avoid UI freezing
- Created a formatted prompt structure with `<file_map>` and `<file_contents>` tags
- Added visual feedback when copying to clipboard (success/error messages)
- Added a loading spinner during the copying process
- Used try/catch blocks for proper error handling
- Added clipboard writing through the Electron clipboard API

## Testing
- Verified that file contents are correctly read and added to the prompt
- Confirmed that the clipboard correctly receives the full prompt
- Tested error handling for binary files and large files
- Checked that the UI correctly displays loading state during copying
- Verified success and error messages show appropriate feedback

## Follow-ups
- Add sorting options for the file selection
- Consider adding a preview of the full prompt with file contents
- Add the ability to select different prompt formats
- Add keyboard shortcuts for common operations
- Consider adding settings to customize the token limit and thresholds
