# Toolbar & Hotkeys Implementation

## What
Implemented a comprehensive toolbar with keyboard shortcuts to improve user efficiency and workflow speed. This feature provides quick access to common actions and allows power users to navigate the application using keyboard commands.

### Key features:
1. Created a unified toolbar component that centralizes key application actions
2. Implemented keyboard shortcuts for all major functionality
3. Added visual feedback when keyboard shortcuts are activated
4. Exposed FileTree component methods via React refs for external control

## Technical Details

### Toolbar Component
- Developed a standalone Toolbar component that aggregates key UI actions
- Included controls for file tree manipulation (expand/collapse all)
- Added file selection controls (select/deselect all)
- Incorporated view toggles (preview/stats)
- Integrated the token counter and copy button for a unified experience

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- Implemented single-key shortcuts for common operations:
  - `E`: Expand all folders
  - `W`: Collapse all folders
  - `P`: Toggle preview panel
  - `S`: Toggle statistics panel
- Added modifier key combinations for selection operations:
  - `Cmd/Ctrl + A`: Select all files
  - `Cmd/Ctrl + D`: Deselect all files
  - `Cmd/Ctrl + C`: Copy selection to clipboard (when eligible)
- Added visual feedback via shortcut badges that highlight when keys are pressed

### Component Refactoring
- Converted the FileTree component to use React.forwardRef
- Exposed internal methods via useImperativeHandle
- Created a FileTreeHandle interface to provide type safety for the ref
- Updated the App component to utilize the exposed methods

## Testing

### Test Cases
1. **Keyboard shortcuts**: Verified that all shortcuts correctly trigger their respective actions
2. **Visual feedback**: Tested that shortcut badges properly highlight when keys are pressed
3. **Focus handling**: Confirmed that shortcuts are ignored when typing in input fields
4. **Responsiveness**: Tested the toolbar layout across different screen sizes
5. **Component integration**: Verified that FileTree methods are properly called from App

### Results
- Successfully improved user workflow efficiency with keyboard shortcuts
- Enhanced the UI with a consolidated toolbar that provides better access to functionality
- Made the application more accessible to power users who prefer keyboard navigation
- Maintained a clean separation of concerns with proper component encapsulation

## Follow-ups
1. Consider adding a keyboard shortcut help modal/overlay
2. Explore customizable keyboard shortcuts in user settings
3. Add support for additional keyboard shortcuts like file type selection filters
4. Implement keyboard navigation for the file tree itself
