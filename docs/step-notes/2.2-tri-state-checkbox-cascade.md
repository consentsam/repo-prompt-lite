# Step 2.2 - Tri-state Checkbox Cascade

## What Was Implemented

1. **Enhanced Selection Reducer with Immer**:
   - Implemented a comprehensive reducer with immer to manage checkbox states
   - Added multiple selection actions: TOGGLE_NODE, SET_NODE_STATE, SELECT_ALL, DESELECT_ALL, etc.
   - Created cascading selection behavior where parent/child states affect each other
   - Implemented proper tri-state logic (checked, unchecked, indeterminate)

2. **Bulk Selection Features**:
   - Added a selection dropdown menu with various selection options
   - Implemented "Select All" and "Deselect All" functionality
   - Added file filtering by extension (TypeScript, React/TSX, JavaScript)
   - Created toggle functionality for all visible nodes

3. **Visual Enhancements**:
   - Added visual feedback for selected items (blue highlight)
   - Improved checkbox design with proper coloring for the three states
   - Added visual indication in the header showing the current selection state
   - Highlighted selected file names with a different color

4. **Accessibility Improvements**:
   - Added keyboard navigation support (Enter, Space, Arrow keys)
   - Implemented proper ARIA attributes for checkboxes (role, aria-checked)
   - Made containers focusable with tabIndex
   - Added global keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd+A for select all, Ctrl/Cmd+D for deselect all)

## Testing

- Verified that checking a parent node selects all its children
- Confirmed that unchecking a parent node deselects all its children
- Tested that when some children are selected and others aren't, the parent shows the indeterminate state
- Checked that bulk operations (select all, select by extension) work correctly
- Tested keyboard navigation and shortcuts
- Verified that selected files are properly tracked and the selection state is propagated to the parent component
- Confirmed that the selection dropdown menu works correctly

## Follow-ups

- Consider adding more filtering options (by file size, modification date)
- Add the ability to invert current selection
- Implement search functionality to find and select specific files
- Consider adding drag selection (click and drag to select multiple items)
