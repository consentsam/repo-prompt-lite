# Step 2.2 - Tri-state Checkbox Cascade

## What Was Done
- Added tri-state checkboxes to the file tree with three states: checked, unchecked, and indeterminate
- Implemented checkbox state propagation using a reducer with `immer` for immutable state updates
- Built cascade behavior where:
  - Checking/unchecking a parent propagates to all children
  - Parent state represents a summary of its children (checked, unchecked, or indeterminate)
- Created a selection tracking mechanism in the App component
- Added a selection summary showing the number of files and total tokens

## Implementation Details
- Used `immer`'s `produce` function to simplify complex nested state updates
- Implemented a custom reducer with two actions: `TOGGLE_NODE` and `SET_NODE_STATE`
- Created a recursive algorithm to update children and parents when a node's state changes
- Added a custom `TriStateCheckbox` component with different visual states
- Used `useEffect` to propagate selected files to the parent component
- Added click handling that prevents event propagation to avoid toggling folder expansion

## Testing
- Verified that checking a parent node selects all its children
- Confirmed that unchecking a parent node deselects all its children
- Tested that when some children are selected and others aren't, the parent shows the indeterminate state
- Checked that the selection summary updates correctly with the number of files and token count
- Ensured that binary or skipped files are properly handled in the selection

## Follow-ups
- Implement clipboard copy functionality in Step 3.3
- Consider adding keyboard shortcuts for selecting/deselecting all files
- Add a visual indicator for files that are too large or binary
