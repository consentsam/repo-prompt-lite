# Step 1.2 - Directory Walk (Main Process)

## What
- Implemented an asynchronous recursive directory walker in the Electron main process
- Added binary file detection and 1MB file size limit
- Created a rough token estimator based on character count
- Implemented progress streaming via IPC to provide real-time feedback
- Added a UI component to display scan progress and results

## Implementation Details
1. Enhanced `main.ts` with:
   - `isLikelyBinary()` to detect binary files based on extension
   - `estimateTokens()` to provide a rough token count estimate
   - Recursive directory walker with progress streaming
   - Skip logic for binary files and files â‰¥ 1MB

2. Extended the preload script to expose new methods to the renderer:
   - `walkDirectory()` to invoke the directory walker
   - `onWalkProgress()` to register for progress events

3. Created a new `DirectoryScanner` component in the renderer to:
   - Display real-time scan progress
   - Show final scan statistics
   - Highlight skipped files

4. Added TypeScript interfaces in `api.d.ts` to ensure type safety

## Testing
- Tested with various folder sizes and structures
- Verified binary file detection works correctly
- Confirmed progress updates stream in real-time
- Ensured proper error handling when access is denied
- Verified token estimation provides reasonable values

## Follow-ups
- Consider adding a more accurate tokenization algorithm (currently using a simple chars/4 estimate)
- Add ability to cancel an in-progress scan
- Consider adding file type statistics (e.g., number of .js, .ts, .jsx files)
- For very large directories, implement lazy loading of subdirectories
