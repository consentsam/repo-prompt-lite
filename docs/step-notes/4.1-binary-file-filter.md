# Step 4.1: Binary / â‰¥ 1 MB filter

## What We Implemented

In this step, we significantly enhanced the binary file detection and filtering functionality:

1. **Advanced Binary File Detection**:
   - Created a dedicated `binaryDetection.ts` utility with enhanced detection logic
   - Implemented content-based binary detection by analyzing file bytes
   - Added configurable options for detection thresholds
   - Enhanced feedback with detailed skip reasons (extension, size, content)

2. **UI for Binary Filter Settings**:
   - Added a new `BinaryFilterSettings` component with configurations for:
     - Maximum file size (configurable from 100KB to 10MB)
     - Content-based detection settings
     - Extension-based detection toggle
     - Binary threshold percentage settings

3. **Visual Improvements**:
   - Enhanced file icons that indicate different skip reasons
   - Added tooltips to explain why files are skipped
   - Added progress metrics for binary file counts during scan
   - Added detailed statistics for skipped files

4. **API Enhancements**:
   - Added `file:checkBinary` endpoint to check binary status
   - Enhanced directory walker to track more statistics
   - Improved renderer-main process communication with options

## Testing

1. **Binary Detection**:
   - Successfully detects binary files by extension
   - Successfully detects binary files by content analysis
   - Properly differentiates between binary and text files

2. **Performance**:
   - Content-based detection is reasonably fast with optimized sampling
   - Only reads the first part of files for detection, improving speed
   - Reports progress during binary detection

3. **User Feedback**:
   - Clear indication of why files are skipped
   - Detailed statistics on binary file counts
   - Easy configuration of detection settings with real-time feedback

## Follow-ups

1. **User Preferences Persistence**:
   - Could save user's binary detection preferences
   - Consider adding presets for different use cases (code-only, include binaries, etc.)

2. **Additional File Type Recognition**:
   - Could add more sophisticated file type detection
   - Consider integrating with libraries like file-type or mime-type detection

3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Consider adding worker thread for binary detection of large repositories
   - Implement cancelable scans for very large repositories
