# Step 2.1 - Virtualised File Tree

## What Was Done
- Created a new `FileTree.tsx` component using `@tanstack/react-virtual` for virtualization
- Implemented a tree structure with collapsible folders using state management
- Added file/folder icons with appropriate Tailwind styling
- Displayed file sizes and token estimates for each file
- Integrated the FileTree component into the main App
- Styled everything with dark-mode Tailwind classes
- Added performance optimizations (memo, virtualization)

## Implementation Details
- Used `useVirtualizer` hook from `@tanstack/react-virtual` to render only the visible portion of the file tree
- Converted flat file list to a hierarchical tree structure with parent-child relationships
- Implemented toggle functionality for expanding/collapsing directories
- Applied consistent styling with Tailwind CSS using the dark theme
- Added file size and token information for files

## Testing
- Verified that the file tree properly displays all scanned files and directories
- Confirmed that expanding/collapsing folders works correctly
- Ensured that directory structure is correctly maintained and displayed
- Checked that virtualization works (only visible items are rendered) for performance
- Confirmed files show their size and token estimate

## Follow-ups
- Add tri-state checkboxes in the next step (2.2)
- Consider adding a search/filter feature for large repositories
- Could enhance with keyboard navigation (arrow keys, etc.)
