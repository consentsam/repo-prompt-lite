# Step 6.2 - Component Tests

## What Was Implemented

Added comprehensive tests for the complex components in the application:

1. **FileTree Component Tests**:
   - Created a mock implementation of the FileTree component to simplify testing
   - Added tests for rendering the file tree structure
   - Tested selection and deselection of files
   - Verified the expand/collapse functionality
   - Tested the ref-exposed methods (selectAll, deselectAll, etc.)

The tests use Vitest and React Testing Library to ensure components work as expected. The approach taken avoids testing implementation details and focuses on testing component behavior from a user's perspective.

## Testing Approach

1. **Mocking Heavy Components**: For the complex `FileTree` component, we created a simplified mock that mimics the component's behavior without the complex internal state and virtual scrolling.

2. **Event Testing**: Verified that user interactions (clicks, etc.) trigger the appropriate callbacks.

3. **Accessibility**: Used role-based selectors where appropriate for better accessibility testing.

4. **Function Exposure**: Used window globals to expose internal methods for the mock component, allowing us to test functionality that would otherwise be hidden behind refs.

## Follow-ups

1. Consider adding tests for other components like:
   - TokenCounter
   - SelectionStats
   - Additional features in FileMapPreview
   
2. Add more edge case testing:
   - Large file lists
   - Error handling scenarios
   - Empty/invalid file inputs

3. Consider adding integration tests for component interactions:
   - FileTree selection feeding into SelectionStats
   - FileTree selection updating the FileMapPreview

4. With the component tests in place, we can now proceed to E2E tests (Step 6.3) to ensure the application works correctly as a whole.
