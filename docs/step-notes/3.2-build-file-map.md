# Step 3.2 - Build `<file_map>`

## What Was Implemented

1. **Enhanced Tree Formatter**:
   - Completely revamped the formatUtils.ts file with a robust tree formatting system
   - Added comprehensive TreeFormatOptions interface to control formatting behavior
   - Implemented proper directory size and token count calculation for better visualization
   - Added support for various sorting options (by name, size, tokens) and sorting direction
   - Created intelligent tree pruning and depth limiting capabilities

2. **Interactive FileMap Preview**:
   - Transformed the FileMapPreview component into a fully interactive interface
   - Added controls for customizing the file map visualization (sorting, filtering, depth)
   - Implemented real-time preview with syntax highlighting for selected files
   - Created a responsive UI with helpful stats and information

3. **Consistent Format Options**:
   - Added default formatting options for the clipboard export (DEFAULT_PROMPT_OPTIONS)
   - Created a system to pass formatting options between components
   - Ensured consistent formatting between preview and actual clipboard output
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

4. **Usability Improvements**:
   - Added options to show file sizes and token estimates in the tree view
   - Implemented "show only selected files" mode to focus on relevant files
   - Added visual highlighting to help identify selected files
   - Included proper handling of binary files with special markers

## Testing

- Verified that the file map is generated correctly with various formatting options
- Confirmed that the preview updates in real-time when options are changed
- Tested that the formatting options are properly passed to the clipboard export
- Ensured that all sorting options work correctly (by name, size, tokens)
- Verified that depth limiting works as expected
- Confirmed that the "show only selected" mode correctly shows only selected files and their parent directories
- Tested that the tree properly calculates directory sizes and token counts

## Follow-ups

- Consider adding search functionality to quickly find files in the preview
- Add the ability to save formatting preferences
- Implement keyboard shortcuts for toggling options
- Consider adding more visualizations for token usage distribution
- Optimize performance for very large repositories with many files
