# Step 3.3: Stream Contents & Clipboard Write

## What We Implemented

In this step, we implemented a streaming file content reader with a 2M token cap enforcement:

1. **Streaming File Reading**:
   - Enhanced `generateFullPrompt` to process files one by one
   - Added progress tracking for file processing
   - Added progress callback to report file processing status to UI
   - Improved token counting and enforcement

2. **Token Limit Enforcement**:
   - Added a 2M token cap in `promptUtils.ts`
   - Implemented token limit checking before adding each file
   - Added notification when token limit is exceeded
   - Return accurate stats about processed vs. total files

3. **UI Improvements**:
   - Added a progress bar showing real-time file processing
   - Enhanced success message to show file processing stats
   - Added messaging for token limit cases
   - Synced token limits between components

## Testing

1. **File Reading**:
   - Successfully reads files and writes content to clipboard
   - Properly skips binary files and files â‰¥ 1MB
   - Properly streams file contents one by one

2. **Progress Monitoring**:
   - Progress indicator updates in real-time while copying files
   - Shows current file being processed
   - Shows current/total file count

3. **Token Limit Enforcement**:
   - Stops reading files when 2M token limit is reached
   - Provides proper messaging when limit is reached
   - Return how many files were processed vs. total selected

## Follow-ups

1. **Performance Improvement**: 
   - File reading could be further optimized with batching or worker threads
   - Consider adding cancel button for large operations

2. **Token Count Accuracy**:
   - Current token estimation is approximate; could be improved
   - Consider allowing custom token limits for different LLM models

3. **User Experience**:
   - Add better error handling for clipboard operations
   - Consider showing more detailed statistics about skipped files
