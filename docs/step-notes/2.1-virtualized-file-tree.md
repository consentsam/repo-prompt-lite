# Step 2.1 - Virtualised File Tree

## What Was Implemented

1. **Enhanced FileTree.tsx Component**:
   - Implemented proper virtualization using `@tanstack/react-virtual`
   - Added a grid-based layout with columns for file name, size, and token count
   - Improved styling with alternating row colors and better visual hierarchy
   - Added proper scrolling behavior with fixed container height

2. **Tree Navigation Improvements**:
   - Added expandable/collapsible folder functionality with animated chevron icons
   - Implemented double-click behavior for directories to expand/collapse
   - Added "Expand All" and "Collapse All" buttons for easier navigation
   - Improved indentation logic for better visual hierarchy

3. **Selection UI Enhancements**:
   - Enhanced the tri-state checkbox behavior for better selection feedback
   - Added visual feedback for waiting on double-click actions
   - Improved file and folder icons with status-based styling
   - Added column headers for better data organization

## Testing

- Verified that the virtualized list renders correctly with large file lists
- Tested expanding and collapsing folders with both icon clicks and double-clicks
- Verified that checkbox selection properly cascades up and down the tree
- Confirmed that the "Expand All" and "Collapse All" buttons work correctly
- Verified that the file tree displays proper information for files (size, tokens) and folders (item count)
- Tested with various folder structures to ensure proper indentation and hierarchy

## Follow-ups

- Consider adding keyboard navigation for accessibility
- May need performance optimizations for very large directory structures
- Could add a search/filter feature to quickly find files in large repositories
