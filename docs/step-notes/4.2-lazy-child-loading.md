# Lazy Child Loading Implementation

## What
Implemented lazy loading for directory children to improve performance when working with large repositories. This optimization helps keep the application responsive by only loading the contents of directories when they are expanded in the file tree.

### Key features:
1. Added a new IPC handler (`directory:lazyLoadChildren`) in the main process to load children of a directory on demand
2. Updated the FileTree component to track directories with loaded children and those currently being loaded
3. Modified the tree rendering to display loading indicators while directories are being fetched
4. Enhanced the tree flattening algorithm to work with dynamically loaded nodes

## Technical Details

### Main Process
- Created `directory:lazyLoadChildren` handler that recursively scans a directory's immediate children
- Reused existing binary detection and token estimation logic for consistency
- Returns file stats along with the children to track size and token usage

### Preload Script
- Exposed the lazy loading handler to the renderer process through the API bridge

### FileTree Component
- Added state tracking for loaded directories and loading status
- Enhanced node expansion to trigger lazy loading when necessary
- Implemented a loading spinner indicator for directories being fetched
- Updated the memoized flattening algorithm to work with partially loaded trees

### App Component
- Added `onFilesUpdate` callback to handle updates to the file list when new directories are loaded
- Updates the scan results state when new files are loaded

## Testing

### Test Cases
1. **Initial tree load**: Verified that only the root level directories load initially
2. **Directory expansion**: Expanded directories load their children only when clicked
3. **Multiple nested levels**: Tested with repositories containing multiple levels of nesting
4. **Loading indicators**: Verified loading spinners appear and disappear correctly
5. **Memory usage**: Monitored memory usage to ensure it stays reasonable even with large repositories

### Results
- Successfully improved performance when working with large repositories
- Reduced initial load time significantly by only loading directories as needed
- Loading indicators provide clear feedback to users during directory expansion
- Memory usage stays much lower as only a portion of the directory tree is loaded at any time

## Follow-ups
1. Add caching for previously loaded directories to avoid reloading
2. Consider implementing virtual scrolling improvements for very large directories
3. Add ability to collapse all directories at once to free up memory
4. Implement progressive loading for directories with large numbers of files
