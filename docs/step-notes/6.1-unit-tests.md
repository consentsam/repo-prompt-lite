# Step 6.1: Unit Tests

## What We Implemented

In this step, we implemented comprehensive unit tests for the key components of the application:

1. **DirectoryScanner Component Tests**:
   - Fixed and enhanced existing tests to match the current implementation
   - Added more coverage for binary detection options
   - Improved mocking of the walkDirectory API
   - Added tests for error handling scenarios
   - Enhanced assertions for scan results display

2. **PromptUtils Module Tests**:
   - Implemented unit tests for the `generateFullPrompt` function that:
     - Verify proper file content inclusion
     - Test token limit enforcement
     - Check progress reporting
     - Ensure proper error handling
   - Created tests for `copyPromptToClipboard` that:
     - Verify successful clipboard operations
     - Test error handling for clipboard access
     - Check token limit exceeded scenarios

3. **Testing Focus Areas**:
   - File reading operations
   - Token limit enforcement
   - Binary file detection
   - Progress reporting
   - Error handling
   - Success feedback

## Testing Details

- **Test Structure**:
  - Used Vitest and React Testing Library
  - Implemented proper mocking of API calls and event listeners
  - Created detailed assertions to verify component behavior
  - Followed AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) test pattern

- **Coverage Areas**:
  - Unit tests for utility functions
  - Component tests for UI behavior
  - Integration tests for clipboard operations
  - Error handling in all scenarios
  - Edge cases like token limits and binary file handling

- **Mock Implementations**:
  - Created realistic mock data for files and directories
  - Simulated API responses for file operations
  - Mocked progress events for directory scanning
  - Added type-safe mocking for clipboard operations

## Follow-ups

1. **Test Coverage Improvement**:
   - Add tests for remaining components (FileTree, Toolbar, App)
   - Increase coverage for edge cases and error handling

2. **E2E Testing**:
   - Prepare for Playwright E2E tests in the next steps
   - Design realistic user flows for testing

3. **Test Automation**:
   - Consider adding automation for running tests in CI
   - Add test coverage reporting
