# Step 6.3: E2E Playwright Tests

## What We Implemented

In this step, we implemented comprehensive end-to-end tests using Playwright to validate the full application functionality:

1. **Playwright Configuration**:
   - Set up a Playwright configuration file with appropriate timeouts and browser settings
   - Configured test reporters for better visibility of test results
   - Added support for running tests in both Chromium and WebKit browsers
   - Set up a web server to serve the application during testing

2. **Web Application Tests**:
   - Created tests for the basic web UI functionality
   - Implemented a helper to create and manage test repositories
   - Tested the complete user flow from folder selection to clipboard copy
   - Added tests for file selection, folder expansion/collapse, and panel toggling
   - Verified token counting functionality with different file selections

3. **Electron-Specific Tests**:
   - Added dedicated tests for Electron-specific functionality
   - Tested IPC communication between main and renderer processes
   - Verified clipboard operations through Electron's clipboard API
   - Tested binary file detection and handling
   - Ensured proper loading and operation of the Electron application

## Testing Strategy

- **Test Data Generation**:
   - Created dynamic test repositories for each test run
   - Generated representative test files (text, code, binary)
   - Implemented proper cleanup to remove test data after tests complete

- **Mocking Native Functionality**:
   - Added methods to bypass native file dialogs for testing
   - Mocked clipboard access in the browser environment
   - Created test helpers to inject data directly into the application

- **Full User Journey Testing**:
   - Covered all major user interactions with the application
   - Tested realistic user flows from start to finish
   - Verified visual feedback and application state throughout

## Technical Details

- **Playwright Features Used**:
   - Page interactions (click, type, navigate)
   - Element locators and assertions
   - Browser context management
   - Electron testing support
   - Test hooks for setup/teardown

- **Test Architecture**:
   - Separation of web and Electron tests
   - Reusable helper functions for common operations
   - Well-organized test structure with clear assertions
   - Proper handling of asynchronous operations

## Follow-ups

1. **CI Integration**:
   - Add GitHub Actions workflow to run tests on CI
   - Set up test reporting and artifact storage for test results

2. **Test Coverage Improvements**:
   - Add more edge cases and error condition tests
   - Test with larger repositories and performance benchmarks

3. **Visual Testing**:
   - Consider adding visual comparison tests for UI components
   - Implement screenshot-based testing for layout verification

4. **Accessibility Testing**:
   - Add tests that verify keyboard navigation
   - Check screen reader compatibility
   - Verify ARIA attributes and focus management
