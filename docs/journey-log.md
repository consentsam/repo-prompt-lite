# Implementation Journey Log

## Step 1.1 - Folder Choose / Drag-Drop (Date: Current Date)

### Summary
Successfully implemented the folder selection functionality with both button-click and drag-drop methods. This allows users to select a folder from their file system that will later be processed for code prompt generation.

### Key Components Created
1. **FolderPicker.tsx** - A React component with:
   - Button to trigger native folder selection dialog
   - Drag-and-drop zone with visual feedback
   - Error handling for invalid selections
   - State management for selected folder path

2. **IPC Communication**:
   - Added `selectFolder()` method in preload script
   - Added `verifyDroppedFolder()` method for validation
   - Implemented secure IPC handlers in main process

3. **TypeScript Types**:
   - Created `types.d.ts` to type the exposed API methods

### Technical Decisions
- Used Electron's dialog API for native folder selection
- Implemented drag-drop using HTML5 drag event handlers
- Added visual feedback during drag operations with Tailwind classes
- Ensured secure IPC communication with contextIsolation and preload script
- Structured component using React hooks for state management

### Challenges & Solutions
1. **Module Type Conflict**:
   - **Issue**: Build error with unterminated string literal due to mixed module systems
   - **Root Cause**: Package.json had `"type": "module"` but config files used CommonJS
   - **Solution**: Removed `"type": "module"` from package.json and standardized on CommonJS
   - **Action**: Deleted duplicate MJS config file to avoid confusion

2. **Drag & Drop Path Extraction**:
   - **Issue**: Getting the full file path from drag-drop events in Electron's sandbox
   - **Solution**: Used the File API's path property and verified it via IPC

### Testing Performed
- Button click to open native folder dialog
- Drag and drop folders from macOS Finder
- Tested error conditions (dropping files instead of folders)
- Verified folder path display in the UI

### Screenshots
*(Would add screenshots here in a real document)*

### Next Steps
Proceed to Step 1.2 - Directory walk to:
- Implement recursive directory traversal
- Add file filtering and token estimation
- Create progress indication UI
